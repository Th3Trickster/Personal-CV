            <strong>Course - Complete JavaScript Course</strong>
            <p>Coming from Java to JavaScript was a tough transition when it came to things like prototype inheritance
              but with
              reasearch and asking questions I finally figured out how and why they were used. This covered ES5 and ES6
              and
              the instructor taught them perfectly. It also covered Asynchronous JavaScript, NPM, Babel, and Webpack. As
              of
              recent the instructor added a node.JS (2019), even though I already knew a bit about node, this crash
              course
              added things that I had yet to learn about node. Overall this course took me over a year to complete
              because
              of how deep JavaScript went.

            <strong>Course - Java Programming Masterclass</strong>
            <p>This course taught me a lot about Java, the instructor taught the topic very well. The projects were very
              challenging
              but this made me learn even more about Java because it made me buy several books just to learn Java even
              further in
              depth. This course taught the basics such as variables and datatypes, methods, and control flow statements
              but also
              went into more advanced topics such as OOP and all that comes with that including inheritance,
              composition, encapsulation,
              and polymorphism. This course also taught data structures such as arrays, linked lists, sets and maps.
              Overall this
              course took me over a year to complete because of all of the challenges it brought with it and the amount
              of reasearch
              and reading I did to be able to tackle these more advanced Java projects.
